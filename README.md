# county-timeline-viewer

This is a project I'm currently working on as an addition to the Florida Memory website. It is a tool that will allow a user to search any modern county and view a timeline and a series of maps that show how these counties have changed since statehood. 

Some of the tools used include Image Mapster which is an html image mapper, and Open Sea Dragon which is a powerful image viewer.

Note - Data for the counties is still in the works so only St. Johns, Escambia and Martin currently work.

Note - These maps are typically used by historians as a guide and are often requested by researchers. They mainly offer a general look into florida and how it's changed overtime. They do not go into specific detail and do not directly correspond with or capture the full history of every county or event and should be used as a guide and not a comprehensive tool. 

Here is a live link for your convenience:

Note: Certain features are not loading properly in the live link, but work when run on a live server. This is a bug that is currently being sorted out.
