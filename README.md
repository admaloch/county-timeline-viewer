# county-timeline-viewer

This is a project I'm currently working on as an addition to the Florida Memory website. It is a tool that will allow a user to search any modern county in the State of Florida and see a rough timeline of how it has changed overtime. The results correspond with a series of maps that show how these counties have changed since statehood. The user will be able to narrow results by a specific date to see what their county was and view a map to see what it looked like at that specified date.

Note - These maps are typically used by historians as a guide and are often requested by researchers. They mainly offer a general look into florida and how it's changed since statehood. They do not go into specific detail and do not directly correspond with or capture the full history of every county or event and should be used as a guide and not a comprehensive tool.
